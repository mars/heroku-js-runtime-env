Usage
-----

Designed for [create-react-app-buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack). See its documentation to use this module for [Runtime configuration](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack/blob/master/README.md#environment-variables).

Background
-----------

Normally javascript apps are compiled into a bundle before being deployed. During this build phase, environment variables may be embedded in the javascript bundle, such as with [Webpack DefinePlugin](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#defineplugin).

When hosting on a [12-factor](https://12factor.net) platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), these embedded values may go stale when setting new [config vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars) or promoting through a [pipeline](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines).

In coordination with the Heroku runtime through a `.profile.d` script setup by [the buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack), this tiny module allows the runtime to inject environment variables into the production javascript bundle without recompiling.
